This is the core of the Rainpress Compressor (svn rev. 41) (minifier, really) 
loosely repackaged as a plugin.  The original code may be found here:
    http://code.google.com/p/rainpress/

I've stripped out all the command-line stuff and just kept the core compressor.
This has the added benefit of not requiring anything (the full version requires
GetText).
